# Remote CMD Access Using Python Socket Programming

This project implements a secure, production-ready server-client application using Python socket programming to enable remote access to a client machine's command prompt (CMD). It addresses real-world needs for remote system administration by providing encrypted communication, authentication, and robust feature sets like rate limiting and session management.

## Features
- **Secure Communication**: Encrypts data transfer between server and client using TLS/SSL.
- **User Authentication**: Requires username and password for client access, enhancing security.
- **Multi-Client Support**: Handles concurrent connections via multi-threading.
- **Rate Limiting**: Caps commands at 60 per minute per client to prevent abuse.
- **Command Sanitization**: Restricts execution to a predefined set of safe commands.
- **Session Management**: Assigns unique session IDs to track client interactions.
- **Logging**: Records server and client activities for debugging and auditing.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.6+**: Core language for server and client scripts.
- **Socket Library**: Facilitates TCP-based network communication.
- **SSL/TLS**: Secures data with Pythonâ€™s `ssl` module and OpenSSL certificates.
- **Subprocess**: Executes CMD commands on the client.
- **Threading**: Enables multi-client handling on the server.
- **python-dotenv**: Manages configuration via environment variables.
- **Logging**: Tracks operations in `server.log` and `client.log`.
- **Git**: Version control for project management.

## Prerequisites
- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher installed ([Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
- **OpenSSL**: Required to generate SSL certificates ([Install](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) for Windows).
- **Git**: For cloning the repository ([Install](https://git-scm.com/downloads)).
